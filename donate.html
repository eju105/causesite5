				  <h1>DONATE A BIKE!!</h1>
				  <p>Whether you are walking, biking or driving to get around the city, the Vision Zero Resource Center has tips to make your trip safer. With new information and research on traffic safety being published all the time, the Vision Zero Team wants you to have the knowledge and power to make each day as safe as possible. Please share this information with friends, family, and coworkers. By creating a network of New Yorkers who are all engaged and educated on street safety, and who prioritize sharing the street, we can create a New York where injuries and fatalities on the road do not exist.

				  Crashes are preventable and it takes all of us to make our streets safer. Together, we can make a difference.

	    			<h1>Don't Have a Bike to Give.. Send Cash!!</h1>
	    			<p class="text-justify">Dear Friends,

						A life lost is a life lost.

						And it is our collective responsibility to save every life we can, be it a life taken in a violent crime or in a crash with a motor vehicle.

						In the first days of our administration, we made a commitment to decisively confront the epidemic of traffic fatalities and injuries on our streets. And with this implementation report, we are laying out an ambitious roadmap to live up to that commitment.

						The fundamental message of Vision Zero is that death and injury on city streets is not acceptable, and that we will no longer regard serious crashes as inevitable. These tragedies happen in every community in our city, to families from every walk of life – from the Upper West Side to Woodside; from Park Slope to Edenwald. They happen to people who drive and to those who bike, but overwhelmingly, the deadly toll is highest for pedestrians—especially our children and seniors.

						We won't accept this any longer. I make that pledge as a parent, and as your mayor.

						We will save lives. That work begins in earnest today.
						Community groups, advocates and—most meaningfully—families who have lost loved ones, have proven that we can change hearts, minds and behaviors. Drunk driving and failure to use seatbelts, once commonplace, are now socially unacceptable. Today, we must bring the same concerted effort against dangerous and careless driving on our streets.

									<p>Why Is Bicycle Safety So Important?
									Bike riding is a lot of fun, but accidents happen. The safest way to use your bike is for transportation, not play. Every year, about 300,000 kids go to the emergency department because of bike injuries, and at least 10,000 kids have injuries that require a few days in the hospital. Some of these injuries are so serious that children die, usually from head injuries.

									A head injury can mean brain injury. That's why it's so important to wear your bike helmet. Wearing one doesn't mean you can be reckless, but a helmet will provide some protection for your face, head, and brain in case you fall down.

									What color is your bike helmet?
									Black
									Blue
									Brown
									Gray
									Green
									Orange
									Pink
									Purple
									Red
									Yellow
									White
